# GameDesignDocMarkdownTemplate
A game design document markdown template

## Thanks Gamasutra!

This is based on [How to Write a Game Design Document](https://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/LeandroGonzalez/20160726/277928/How_to_Write_a_Game_Design_Document.php). A fun read.


## To use

You can clone this repo, or just download the template doc folder and add it to your game repo. Then edit the game design doc, and away you go!

Good luck!
